Descriptive Statistics and Hypothesis Testing in Python

This project serves as the final project for the "Statistics for Data Science with Python" course on Coursera (link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistics-for-data-science-python?specialization=data-science-fundamentals-python-sql). Â  

Data Source:

The dataset used in this project was provided by the course creators.

Project Tasks:

1. Familiarize with the Dataset: Explore and understand the structure and content of the data.
2. Generate Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations: Summarize the dataset characteristics and create informative visualizations to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
3. Hypothesis Testing: Conduct appropriate statistical tests to answer specific questions about the data, such as comparing means, identifying correlations, or testing for significance.
